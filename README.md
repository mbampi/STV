Database

The used database in this project was the Google Firebase Realtime Cloud Database, based on JSON. The java-admin Firebase API was used to set the database routines. The database structure is based in two main parents, called Users (taking as “primary key” the username) and Hikes (taking as “primary key” an unique key). Relationship in Firebase is made with parent and children nodes using the primary keys.

As we see in the images, the data is all stores in parent-child relationship, all values being stores with key and value. For multiple value data, is necessary a new parent node creation, storing its values as children. In this case, the use of and ID is necessary, even if the unique key is not a necessary data, as used in the hikes node.

Google Firebase works with asynchronous data retrieving, making our software development harder as a first-time user. However, after reading the Firebase documentation and asynchronous methods in Java, we made it possible with the use of callbacks. Our connection, data saving, data deleting, data updating and data retrieving with the database is working properly, with no sync problems.

DAO (Database Access Objects) were created as java classes to provide a better control between Models and Database, for CRUD operations. A static database manager class was created to set the database creating and configuration and providing the unique database instance in the running time execution.
